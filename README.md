# NULL-tac

This is a project to develop a 2-D tactical game.  It was started as a way for me to learn new technologies and frameworks through actual development.

At the same time, I will also apply agile development best practices.  I have used them professionally, but this is a way to consolidate my experience and make these practices more habitual.

- Automated testing
- Story and sprint-based planning
- Version control
- DevOps
